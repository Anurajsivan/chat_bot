Good Evening team,

As discussed in our team Huddle held on September 17th, 2025, please find the Minutes of Meeting (MOM) below,

Documentation Guidelines:
	Calling encounters should be documented properly, and if notes are added on the next business day, documentation should be clear enough for QA to understand during audits.
 
Adjustment Task:

	While creating an adjustment task, the balance should be placed under the correct insurance. For example, if an adjustment is created for Primary WC with a 109-adjustment task, the balance should remain in the Primary Insurance bucket.
 
Rework Required Task:
	When creating a Rework Required task, comments should clearly mention what rework was done on the encounter.

Appeals Follow Up:

	While working on Appeals follow-up inventory, if SSG (Q codes) and MLI (T codes) are billed in the claim form and an appeal was already submitted for that claim, do not assign it directly to the respective Lead/Manager. First, follow up with the payer on the submitted appeal. If the appeal is upheld and requires further action, then assign the claim. If the appeal is still In-Progress and needs more time, take the appropriate action accordingly.

Unreachable Payer Task:

	If you are unable to reach the payer after 3 or more attempts on different days and times, create an Unreachable Payer task. Before creating this task, kindly check other DOS to see if anyone was able to reach the payer using a different number.
	If you have requested an EOB 3 or more times and the payer has not sent it (through fax, mail or email) and created Unreachable Payer task. Kindly mention ‘EOB Required’ in the subject line.
 
Modifiers :
 
	Only modifiers GW, 51, RT and LT for Biopsy Codes are Approved to be added from the associate end.

Good morning, Team,


As per our discussion during the team Huddle on September 10, 2025, please see the Minutes of Meeting (MOM) provided below.


POS Related issue :
•	To proceed with the invalid denial of procedure codes and POS, it is necessary to verify the POS and procedure code for any inaccuracies. If the information is found to be incorrect and confirmed, it must be documented properly and assigned to leads for review, who will then reassign it to coders. If the billing is accurate, it is necessary to contact the payer and reprocess the claim        

SSG CODES
•	SSG Codes (Q codes)  Medical records request must include Candidate notes. Therefore, it is necessary to assign this task to Kaier Rose and update the subject to Medical Record Request.

Updating Carrier code 
•	To prevent future denials and rejections from the Medicaid payer, it is necessary to update the carrier code in both NG and Waystar. This action will help mitigate the impact of ongoing rejections and denials.

Adjustment Task 

•	Adjustments errors must be completed within 72 hours; otherwise, the unaddressed adjustments will be subtracted from the total monthly production.

Appeals
•	Packages that are appealed must be created on the same day and should be placed in the respective paths.


Note: The Mail has shared the updated protocol for appeals, along with revisions to the path guidelines and appeal guidelines. Kindly review the information.

Good Morning Team,

As discussed in our team Huddle held on September 08, 2025, please find the Minutes of Meeting (MOM) below,

COB Pending:

	If a secondary claim is denied stating they are secondary and the primary payer is inactive for the DOS, do not bill the claim to primary payer, just to obtain a denial EOB and to submit the claim to secondary. Instead, add COB pending in payer sequence as the primary payer and keep the balance under primary payer. For example, if Medicare Part B (primary) is inactive and the secondary payer denies stating they are secondary, do not bill the claim to Medicare for a denial EOB. 
	Submitting the claim to secondary with Primary denied EOB is the last option taken by RI team when they were unable to patient or update the COB information with payer.

Medicare Eligibility:

	If Medicare Eligibility returning as below, do not consider Medicare as active and do not bill the claim to Medicare.
 

Medical Records Request:

	If a claim is billed with SSG Codes (Q codes) and medical records are requested, it should not be submitted with only medical records. Candidate notes must also be included. Kindly assign these tasks to Rose Kaiser.

DX Related denials:

	Dx related denials should not be routed for coding assistance. Kindly submit the appeal/reconsideration accordingly.

RE: MOM 08/20/2025



Good evening, Team, 



As discussed in our team Huddle held on August 20’ 2025, please find the Minutes of Meeting (MOM) below,



1️⃣ Smart Edit Rejection



•	For any Smart Edit Rejection, confirm whether it is related to coding changes before proceeding with claim submission.



2️⃣ E\&M Issue Handling



•	Always call the Payer to collect valid and current information for each Date of Service (DOS).

•	If the E\&M code was paid to a different provider, proceed with adjustment.

•	If denied due to the “once in 14 days” rule, keep the claim in progress with a 45-day follow-up. Use subject line: E\&M Issue.

•	Do not reset follow-up if a claim is already assigned for E\&M issue. Instead, inform the lead about the specific encounter.

•	Avoid taking action based on previous call notes—validate each DOS independently via Payer call.



3️⃣ Weekend Allocation



•	Maintain 97% in both production and quality to qualify for weekend allocation.

•	Daily targets must be met consistently—weekend allocation is intended to boost weekly production, not to compensate for missed weekday work.

•	This contributes directly to incentive eligibility.



4️⃣ Proper Documentation



•	Be meticulous with documentation, especially for adjustment actions.

•	If an appeal is upheld and adjustment is needed, include: 

o	Claim denial reason

o	DCN#/CASE#/TICKET#

o	Appeal upheld date

o	Appeal upheld reason

o	For SNF scenarios: mention the date range

•	Incomplete documentation will be returned for rework. Ensure valid and complete documentation for every claim.



5️⃣ Curana Health Encounters



•	Do not work on encounters related to Curana Health that are under Medical Records Audit correspondence.



6️⃣ General Updates



•	Prioritize commercial payer accounts to ensure timely action before TFL is exceeded.

•	If one claim is denied and another for the same patient with a different DOS is paid, call the Payer to validate the discrepancy.



Let’s continue to maintain high standards and ensure every action is backed by accurate data and documentation. For any clarifications, feel free to reach out to your respective leads.

Subject: RE: MOM 08/06/2025







Good evening, Team,



1\. Amerigroup Medicare HMO:



• Authorization is not needed for Wound Care, PICO, UC, DDP, or Mist Procedures for the payer Amerigroup Medicare HMO, under the entity Vohra Post Acute Care Physicians of Texas.

• If Amerigroup Medicare HMO claims are denied as non-covered with remark code CO-204, do not proceed with an auth reconsideration/appeal.

→ Note: NG creating a Denial Auth task does not mean the claim was denied due to lack of authorization.



&nbsp;

Steps to follow:

✔️ Call the payer and confirm the reason for the non-covered denial

✔️ If the rep states the issue is related to no auth, ask them to reprocess the claim

✔️ If the denial is due to medical necessity – appeal

✔️ If the denial is due to member benefit plan, verify if the patient is responsible

✔️ If a secondary payer is available – bill accordingly



2\. WellCare – MolecuLight (T-Code):



• Claims with T-codes are already excluded from inventory.

• If any encounters are received from WellCare with authorization denial related to T-codes, assign them to @Naybel De Vega \& keep inprogress



&nbsp;





3\. Incorrect Billing – Split Claims:



• When claims with multiple CPTs are billed as a split claim and receive partial denial or payment, and:

•	A corrected claim is submitted with all CPTs,

•	But the system still splits the claim automatically,

→ Hold these encounters until further updates.

Sample Encounter: 11928508



&nbsp;



4\. Zelis EOB Requests:



• If any payer suggests to get the EOB from Zelis portal, we should contact the Zelis through (877-828-8770)



&nbsp; If someone had previously requested do not copy paste the same notes as we had change health issue earlier, we weren't receiving eob’s but now eob's are being faxed based on the requests.



• Example payers:

•	Cigna HealthSpring

•	Community Health Choice



5\. Globally Bundled Denials (CO-97):



• When a claim is billed with only an E\&M code and denied as inclusive/bundled (CO-97):

Steps:

✔️ Check the remark code in the Waystar remit

✔️ Review prior DOS for any surgery or biopsy

✔️ Verify the diagnosis code and medical records

•	If treatment was done in the same area and same diagnosis – adjust the claim

Good morning, Team!

&nbsp;

Hope this email finds you well.



&nbsp;As discussed in our team meeting held on August 4’ 2025, please find below the Minutes of Meeting (MOM).



1\. Paid Pending Processing

•	For each paid pending posting, create a single task per check number, grouping all encounters under one task.

For an example, if you are working on the multiple encounters for the same patient, just create a single Paid Pending Processing task and mention the subject with the format (Encounter#\_BulkCheck/EFT$\_Check/EFT#) (pls refer the formats with AR Paid Pending Protocol based on the scenario), so that the EOB will be posted for all the encounter for the patient



Important: Before task creation, verify the check number isn’t already captured in the shared drive path to avoid duplication.



2\. CO109 Denial

•	Investigate the specific reason for the CO109 denial code.

•	Check eligibility status thoroughly and work according to the denial 



3\. BCBS NC

•	Matthew Benenati is not yet linked. 

•	Please do not work any encounters for BCBS NC as the provider is still pending to be linked.



4\. Credentialing in Modio

•	If a provider is marked “In Process” in Modio, do not proceed with their encounters until full credentialing is complete.

•	For providers stuck in the credentialing queue, notify the supervisor to remove those encounters.



5\. Waystar Appeals / Forms

•	When emailing to add the payer in Waystar, include the appeal form and the encounter number. If there is no appeal form needed please ensure to mention it in the email.

Good morning, team!

&nbsp;

Hope this email finds you well.

&nbsp;

1\.	As discussed in our team meeting held on July 30’ 2025, please find below the Minutes of Meeting (MOM). 



Zero Pay Partially:

Moving forward if we are working on an encounter and notice that one of the CPT balances is completely adjusted, we need to investigate the reason for the adjustment and follow up accordingly. If the balance is already adjusted and in case, we reverse the incorrect adjustment instead to creating review and correct posting task kindly send out an email to Zuly cc your leads.

Example Enc#11437169

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

2\.  Updated Process Guidelines:



&nbsp;    When we submit corrected claim and it should retain the original claim number, please push the claim out instead of set to rebill. 

&nbsp;      Also, when the claim has negative balance or it has zero balance kindly push the claim out when rebilling.

Task Creation Guidelines:

&nbsp;     If the claim has only one CPT with a positive balance that needs adjustment

&nbsp;           Create a Request to Initiate Task and an Adjustment Task within the same claim.

&nbsp;    If the claim has multiple CPTs with positive balances, but only one CPT needs to be adjusted

&nbsp;           Create a Review and Correct Posting Task instead.

&nbsp;           In the notes, clearly mention which CPT needs to be adjusted.

Note requirements for "Review and Correct Posting" tasks: 

&nbsp;            What needs to be reviewed

&nbsp;            What needs to be corrected

&nbsp;

3\. General Information:

&nbsp;   If an appeal has already been submitted, but the next day an associate rework the claim and states that the appeal is not required, do not delete the appeal package. Instead, place it in their respective shared drive for record- keeping.            

&nbsp;

4\. Overpayment Dispute: 

&nbsp;   If the overpayment invoice has been closed and Days lapsed, kindly use the 'Dispute' option available on the Claim Status page.

Please find below the Minutes of Meeting held on July 14, 2025:
 
Update Regarding Rocky Mountain:

If you receive any encounters for the payer Rocky Mountain in your allocation, please exclude them for now. As there is and ongoing issue that has already been escalated to Zuly.( Issue details: We are receiving denials related to Place of Service (POS). Although the Hospitalization Date is visible in both NextGen and Waystar, the payer is unable to see it on their end.)
 
Appeal Address Missing in Waystar:
•	If the appeal address is not available in Waystar, please refer to the email shared from Liliana/ Suresh and share an email with all the requested information in the body of the email to your respective Leads.

Medicare Update:
•	When creating an appeal form through Waystar, it is acceptable for the Entity Name to appear as a partial name, as reflected in Waystar (e.g., VOHRA POST ACUTE CARE PHYS).
 

General Updates:
•	For SSG codes, please use the adjustment code as per the denial reason.
•	Ensure the appeal submission date is updated in the encounter-specific field.

Hi Team,

Please find the below MOM for 07/09/2025. 

1.	Zelis offset EOBs - Zelis portal does not have offset EOB's so need to call the actual payer and ask information with provider rep or supervisor. Then escalate to upper management with Subject line as Zelis/Offset and assigned task to Naybel. No need to create dummy EOBs.
2.	Lock in Plan: When we received a denial from payer stating Services not authorized by PCP. Need to verify if the patient has Lock in plan if so, claims should be processed by the facility. So, we need to create a facility call for the RI Team to inquire as to whether the facility will pay us for the services rendered. Example Encounters- 11329956, 11299638, 11330428.
3.	Please do not create review correct posting task to remove the payer from the sequence or directly remove the payer from the sequence for the following scenario : Medicare paid and crossed over the EOB to AARP and AARP denied as not active and we find that Medicaid is active in this case we need to move Medicaid to secondary and move the AARP to tertiary as a denied EOB is posted for AARP.

General Instructions –
1.	When claim is denied for patient is not eligible for DOS then need to go with 1 level appeal with valid proof of initial submission of payer.
2.	Do not remove active tick mark from primary payer if working for last DOS.
3.	When creating adjustment task if the line balance is more than the billed amount, please create review and correct posting task. Please the below snip for reference.

Good morning, Team!!
 
Hope this Email finds you well.
 
Molina Healthcare:

* Do not submit Reconsideration for Molina Healthcare, as it will Rejected, So submit an appeal instead of reconsideration

BCBS MA:

* While working on BCBS MA where claim denied due to Medical Record, Verify the PAYSPAN EOB where we will find the correct Fax number to submit the MR for BCBS MA.

 

Medicaid IN DME Codes:

* As per the Coding Review task, Naybel came across encounters where DME codes are Denied as Invalid POS. Medicaid Indiana does not pay A codes when reported with POS 32 
Action: Need to adjust the claim

Please refrain from creating coding review for the above scenario for the payer Medicaid IN.

 

General Update:

* While working on Eligibility issue, while checking eligibility and we found the Correct payer is primary for the DOS, please make sure we update the Primary information in the Patient Information Tab.
* Also make sure to update the Patient Demographic as per the primary payer Eligibility (e.g., Name, Address) in NG to ensure accuracy.
* Please ensure the correct Adjustment Code is used according to the new protocol to avoid errors. 
* When submitting an appeal via fax or portal, please do not include a cover letter.

Thanks,

Hello Team,
As discussed in our team meeting held on July 2, 2025, please find below the key points and action items. Kindly review carefully and ensure adherence to the following guidelines:
1.	Refund Check Process Example:
Example ENT#10181180: A claim was initially paid by Cigna, but later a recoupment letter was received. Cigna specified that they do not allow offsets; payment must be made via check to their overpayment address. Therefore, the refund must be processed using the check refund process.
Action:
•	A request must be created by creating Request to initiate take back task in NG.
•	Once the check is issued, it will be posted as a refund to insurance, and the check will be posted in NG.
•	If any related tasks (e.g., No Response Medicaid or No Response Commercial) are received later, the team may    process them accordingly.
•	If the refund is already posted and there is no patient responsibility, then the balance can be adjusted based on the scenario.
 
2.	Claim Rebilling Issue:
General update:
    BBP will not push the claim out if claim is at Zero balance or in negative balance.
Instructions/Action Items:
•	Reverse the adjustment.
•	Move the balance under the insurance bucket.
•	Set the claim status to "Rebill."
•	For negative balances, a manual push is required, even in cases of rejection.
 
3.	Appeal Denial Letter:
Reminder:
As noted in previous MoM, when creating denial appeal letters in NextGen, update the encounter specifics to ensure all relevant data appears correctly on the letter.

Good morning, Team!!
 
Hope this Email finds you well.
 
AWS Access:
•	If AWS is not working or inaccessible, immediately escalate the issue to your respective Team Lead for further assistance.
 
ACL Update:
•	The standard Appeal Cover Letter can be found in the Forms tab.
•	For making any updates or changes to the ACL, use the “Appeal Cover Letter Type 2” available in the Forms tab.
 
•	Update the following fields under the ‘Appeal Cover Letter Type 2’ tab:
•	Payer Type First Appeal
•	Appeal Address 1
•	Appeal Address 2
•	Appeal City, State, Zip
•	After printing the ACL Type 2, revert the “Payer Type First Appeal” field back to “Financial Class.”
•	If you have multiple encounters, print a separate ACL for each Date of Service (DOS). Do not use the same ACL for multiple DOS – it becomes non-readable when uploaded to Towne Mailer.
 
Medstar Family Billing Clarification:
•	If a claim includes both an E/M code and a selective debridement code, and the E/M is denied while the debridement is paid. The denial reason refers to it being a non-facility service and not covered per the Medicaid fee schedule.
•	If the facility is linked with SNF but was billed as a Nursing Facility, cross-check the fee schedule.
•	If the CPT is not applicable for the nursing facility per the schedule, you may proceed to adjust the denied service accordingly.
 
G-Codes:
•	If G-codes appear in allocation, assign them under “Naybel.”
 
Eligibility Update in NG:
•	Any updates to eligibility information in NG (NextGen) must be done under the “Benefit Info” tab.
 
                            
•	This ensures proper tracking and helps identify the user who made the update.
 
Eligibility Check in NG:
•	When running eligibility in NG, make sure FYI information is correct before billing the claim.
•	If you notice any incorrect patient info, update it and then bill the claim. Example encounter# 11554801.
 
 
Medicaid GA:
•	Medicaid Georgia (MCD GA) does not pay for CPT 99308 if it's billed with modifier 25.
•	If denied, adjust the claim. Do not send an appeal.
 
Task Creation in NG:
•	When creating a task in NG, the "assign to" field is usually auto filled.
•	If you change it manually, double-check that it’s going to the correct department.
•	For Example: For "Request to initiate take back", assign the task to the Refund department.
 
 
Refund:
•	If you see auditor name: Cindra Linton’s name on a correspondence letter, do not create a refund task.
•	Instead, assign the encounter to Naybel. She’s working directly with the auditors.
•	we already received a recoupment letter from the payer, and we’ve submitted MR for those and have a confirmation with the auditors, that the MR was received and it was in review in their end.
 
Medicaid- Non covered:
•	For Medicaid, few states will not cover selective debridement codes - SC, IA, NJ, NY, TN, DC, OK, MN. In these cases, we can go ahead and adjust the claim.
 
Appeal via Waystar:
General Guidelines:
•	Waystar appeal creation should be used only for mail and fax appeal. It does not include portal submissions.
•	Not all fields in Encounter Maintenance need to be filled.
•	Only update the reconsideration date or appeal date.
•	If appealing to a Medicare HMO, make sure to update the Medicare ID in the General tab.
Appeal Package Creation:
•	From now on, all appeal packages must be created in Waystar.
•	If submitting the appeal by fax or portal, ACL is NOT required.
•	Remove the ACL before downloading the package.
•	If ACL is mistakenly added, it will be marked as a critical error.
•	Refer to the protocol titled “Appeal submission through Waystar” shared by @Milan Gowda.
Choosing the Correct Appeal Form:
•	If a specific dispute form is provided by the payer, choose the form in “Appeal Form.”
•	If there’s no specific form, choose “Generic Appeal Form.”
•	Do not select “Appeal form (Optional)” unless you are using specific dispute form.
•	We use Generic Appeal Form because we don’t have characteristic control.
                              
Adding Denial Information:
•	Since we don’t print denial letters in NextGen, copy and paste the denial message from the letter into the red box on the next screen.
•	To reach this screen, click Continue after selecting the form.
•	If you can’t paste the info, attach the denial letter instead.
 
Escalation:
•	If you can’t find the claim in Waystar, escalate to Liliana.
•	If you received an upheld letter and it is already posted in NG, we won’t be able to create a second-level appeal in Waystar yet, because the remittance will not be updated.
•	If the appeal address from Waystar is different than what the payer representative gave, escalate to Liliana and email Suresh to get the address updated in Waystar.

Hello Team,
 
As discussed in our team meeting held on June 23’ 2025, please find below the Minutes of Meeting (MOM). Kindly review and adhere to the following action items and guidelines:
 
Usage of Correct Dispute Forms and Letterheads:
 
•	It is mandatory to always use the correct dispute form that matches the appeal or reconsideration type. Incorrect forms will lead to rejection, delays, and unnecessary rework.
•	When printing letters from Nextgen, ensure the letterhead aligns with the appropriate level of appeal or reconsideration.
 
Appeal – Portal & Fax Submissions:
 
•	If you encounter an internal error while submitting an appeal via the portal or fax, do not alter or correct the documents already placed in the designated path.
•	Any appeal submitted through the portal should remain as it is, despite internal errors, to maintain audit integrity and avoid discrepancies.
 
Rebill Scenario:
 
•	In rebill cases, the entire Date of Service (DOS) should always be rebilled in full without leaving out any part. (Except for Medicare payer)
•	You are allowed to work on related open tasks even if those are assigned to another user, but please notify your leads to prevent duplicate work.
 
Timestamp:
 
•	When unable to apply a timestamp in specific situations, document the reason clearly in the NG notes.
•	For example, if the primary work is complete but secondary posting is still in progress, ensure you mention this in the notes to avoid audit errors.
 
Premium Not Paid:
 
•	If the patient does not have an active payer, update the task to reflect that a facility call is needed.
•	When processing claims with remark codes N615, N616, N617, or N618, do not immediately bill the patient. First, confirm with the payer whether premium grace period letters were sent.
•	If all three letters were sent with no patient response, and the claim was processed with PR denial, then billing the patient is appropriate. Otherwise, the claim must remain on follow-up until the grace period ends.
Document all payer interactions in detail, including how many letters were sent, the last letter date, expected follow-up date, and whether the claim will be reprocessed or the policy will terminate.
 
Refund Letters from Payers:
 
•	When handling old Date of Service (DOS) claims involving refunds or offsets, carefully check if the refund was already sent to the payer even if it was posted in NG.
•	If the payer has not received the refund, create a “Request to Initiate Take Back” task for further review.
•	For check refunds, follow the designated check refund process and do not upload offset or refund letters in this scenario.
•	If a refund was completed via check, upload the check details in Nextgen correspondence for proof.
•	Posting a refund in NG indicates that the letter was sent, but not necessarily that the payer received the payment.
 
PTAN Issue – Provider Lisa Dore M:
 
•	A missing facility detail was identified for Provider Lisa Dore M, which is causing claim rejections.
•	The PTAN (Provider Transaction Access Number) must be updated in NG to resolve this issue promptly.
 
 
Please ensure strict adherence to the above points. If you require any clarification or support, feel free to reach out to your respective leads.

Hello Team,

As discussed in our team meeting held on June 18’ 2025, please find below the Minutes of Meeting (MOM). Kindly review and adhere to the following action items and guidelines:

1. General Updates:
	Avoid multiple or unnecessary touches on a single encounter unless further resolution is required.
	Do not work on pencil posting claims—once posting is done, the system will auto-create the task.
	If a claim is entered in NG today, do not create a task or rebill it the next day.
	Avoid working on claims that are less than 30 days old, unless they are part of a special project.

2. Task Creation:
	Do not create a task for COB2. Currently, our focus is on COB1 only.
	If we receive a secondary remittance stating "primary got adjudicated" before receiving the primary remittance, do not create a Medicare denial review package.
	For bulk credential issues, escalate to your lead instead of creating separate tasks for each encounter.
	Do not create a coding review task without first calling the payer to gather specific details.

3. Billing & Follow-up Process:
	If the primary payer denies a claim with PR, you may bill it directly to the secondary payer. If the secondary payer denies, bill the patient, except in the case of Medicaid and Medicaid MCOs.
	If a teammate has already followed up and requested a remittance, do not send another request. Instead, connect with the person who previously worked on the claim.

4. Incentive & Productivity Monitoring:
	For team members eligible for incentives, any unnecessary touches, or tasks (e.g., Medicaid TX claims) will be removed from the monthly production file. Please ensure all touches and tasks are valid.
	Weekend allocation requires 100% inventory allocation in production and over 97% QA (green) for Monday–Wednesday. Special projects will be assigned based on both performance and quality.

5. Work From Home (WFH) Protocol:
	If you face internet, power, or personal emergencies while WFH, inform your lead, Bharath, Naybel, or Kristen immediately. Failure to report may result in Leave Without Pay (LWP) for low production.

6. Special Projects & QA:
	When working on a special project, update the subject line as “Special Project” so that QA can recognize the work.
	BCBS MA contractual adjustments are not posting in NG. If you notice trends, please report them to your lead.
	For dual plans, work on secondary balances except in adjustment-only scenarios.

7. Appeals & Escalations:
	If you send an escalation email and receive no response within 1–2 weeks, please send a follow up email.
	For missing appeal packages, inform your lead once the rework has been completed.
	For BCBS FL HMO, PPO, and Blue Card claims: If code 97610 is denied as Experimental/Investigational, these must go through the appeal process.

Hello Team,

As discussed in our team meeting held on June 16’ 2025, please find below the Minutes of Meeting (MOM). Kindly review and adhere to the following action items and guidelines:

Medicaid TX – “Set to Bill - Green Tick” Status Required:

	Ensure all Medicaid Texas claims are kept under “Set to Bill – Green Tick” status. This allows the Credentialing Team to handle any claims that are on hold.
 
BCBS AL – Claims Currently Handled by RI Team:

	All claims related to BCBS Alabama are being processed by the Revenue Integrity team. Please exclude them from your workflow until further notice. 

BCBS NY – Eligibility Verification in Progress by RI Team:

	The Revenue Integrity team is assisting with eligibility verification for BCBS NY. Only proceed with tasks marked High Priority or flagged for follow-up after an appeal or claim submission by the RI team. 

Peak TPA and Peak PACE – State-Specific Submission Rules:

	For Peak TPA and PACE plans, if eligibility shows "Cambridge Health Alliance," submit to Payer ID# MPSAB for MA state, effective June 1, 2025. For Harvard plans and Florida state, continue submitting to Innermark as listed in NextGen.
	Attached with this email a detailed claim submissions information from @Venkatesan Veerappan - RCM. Kindly review and follow the updates accordingly.
 
Kaiser Permanente Mid Atlantic – Appeal Process Update:

	Appeals should now be submitted using the new Dispute Form and strictly via mail. Fax submissions will no longer be accepted. Report any contradictory instructions from payers to your lead immediately.
 
Q-Code Denials – Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) Guidelines:

	Use Adjustment Code 120 only if the patient is on SNF, one appeal has been sent, and the appeal is upheld. For other denials, apply the relevant wound care adjustment codes based on the specific reason.
 
Commercial SNF – Post-Appeal Task Handling:

	For upheld appeals under Commercial SNF, do not move tasks to In-Progress. Keep them in "Not Started" status so the Audit team can review before any adjustment is made.

General Points:

	Weekend Allocation Guidelines – Work Only Assigned Tasks:
Please do not work on Related Encounters during weekends—only the tasks directly allocated to you. Also, weekend-assigned tasks should not be worked on weekdays, as these will be excluded from your production count if found.

	Bulk Encounters / Out-of-Box Handling – Prior Communication Required:
If you're working on bulk tasks or using a non-standard approach that results in payment, inform your GC and TL in advance. This ensures the QA team is aligned, avoiding unnecessary flags during audits.

	NG Notes Handling – Avoid Editing, Use “Additional Notes”:
Do not alter existing NG notes even if revisiting a task on the same day. Always add a new note marked as “Additional Notes” when updating or clarifying prior comments.

	Focus Area – COB1 Tasks Only:
Please stay focused on working only COB1 tasks unless instructed otherwise to ensure cleaner audits and better billing accuracy.

Monday Motivation – "The Stonecutter's Lesson"

There once was a stonecutter who struck a rock over and over—without any change. But on the 101st strike, the rock split in two. It wasn’t that final strike alone that made the difference—it was every one that came before.

Remember, your consistent efforts are what lead to breakthroughs. Let’s stay committed to every task, every day, to build stronger quality and productivity together.




06/11/2025

Greetings Team,

As discussed in our team meeting held on June 11’ 2025, please find below the Minutes of Meeting (MOM). Kindly review and adhere to the following action items and guidelines:

Claim Submission Guidelines – Manual vs. System Auto-Generation: 

	Claims for all financial classes except Medicaid should not be submitted manually. Instead, keep them in “Set to Rebill” status—BBP will handle automatic generation daily for both primary and secondary payers.
	When the Transaction tab displays more than one ICN, it’s necessary to manually generate and submit the claim. This ensures the correct ICN is used and prevents rejections due to mismatches.
	For Medicaid states like CA, OH, and NY that require corrected claims, submit manually, and ensure no resubmission code 7 or original claim number is included. Follow corrected claim guidelines carefully to avoid denial.
	Always follow the standard workflow for time stamping. Before submitting a claim, remove any duplicate or second lines to prevent processing issues or claim rejection.

Humana MCR – Telemedicine Denial Appeals:

	If a denial is received due to telemedicine service frequency limits, appeal once using CMS documentation that confirms lifted restrictions for 2024 & 2025. (Attached are the guidelines along with this email).
	If the appeal remains upheld, then proceed with claim adjustment.

Humana South Florida – Cherrie Hart Provider Encounters:

	Do not work on encounters related to Humana South Florida and Cherrie Hart. These are handled as a special project by Revenue Integrity—mark them as non-workable and escalate to your lead for exclusion tagging.

Patient Demographics – Update to Match Primary Eligibility:

	Always verify and update the patient’s name and address to exactly match what appears under primary eligibility. 
	This includes suffixes (Jr., Sr., II, III) and detailed address info to avoid payer mismatch issues.


We are halfway through the week—a great moment to pause, reflect, and push harder towards our weekly goals. 

Stay mindful of both quality and speed, and let’s ensure we finish the week stronger than we started.

Subject: MOM 06092025

Hello Team,

As discussed in our team meeting held on June 9’ 2025, please find below the Minutes of Meeting (MOM). Kindly review and adhere to the following action items and guidelines:


SNF (Skilled Nursing Facility) Denial Handling:

	For Medicare SNF denials, assign the task to Team 6 for follow-up.
	If the denial is from Medicare HMOs or Commercial Payers, verify SNF eligibility, and if appropriate, appeal the claim.
	When an appeal is upheld, and the correspondence letter includes details about other facility info and SNF dates, document this thoroughly in the notes, correct the POS to 31, and refile the corrected claim.
	If no information is available in the appeal letter or eligibility resources, refund the payment to the payer and proceed with an adjustment.
	It is mandatory that we should have appeal upheld letter when proceeding with adjustment for SNF cases, also for Humana payers we can print the upheld conversation from Overpayments as proof.

Claim Submission Guidelines:

	Do not manually submit claims for any financial class (except Medicaid). Instead, set the claim to “Rebill” status, as the BBP system auto-generates these claims daily.
	Exceptions: If the transaction tab lists multiple ICNs, you must manually generate the claim to ensure the correct ICN is populated.
	For Medicaid payers like CA, OH, and NY that require corrected claims, send them out manually. For resubmissions, do so only for Medicaid cases.
	In timestamp-required scenarios, follow standard workflow and delete the second line of the claim.

BCBS NC – DDP Code Denials:

	For PR denials like medical necessity or non-covered services under BCBS NC, submit one level of appeal.
	This is because some payments have been observed post-appeal, even if the service wasn’t on the Medicare fee schedule. Avoid direct adjustment without appeal.

Review & Correct Posting Task:

	If payments are posted under the wrong insurance or financial class, update the payer sequence and create a Review and Correct Posting task.
	Ensure the task includes accurate information to assist in making the necessary corrections effectively.

 

Refund-Related Updates:

	When a claim is paid but the payer later requests a refund due to inactive coverage on the Date of Service (DOS), initiate a take-back request.
	Resubmit the claim to an active payer, even if the timely filing limit is exceeded, to obtain a formal denial before proceeding with an adjustment.

Claims Denied with PR-55:

	If the claim is denied with PR-55 (e.g., past timely filing or original decision upheld on appeal), proceed with adjustment.
	Do not bill these claims to the secondary payer or patient, as no follow-up is allowed when the primary payer denies the claim.


“A diamond is just a piece of coal that handled stress exceptionally well.”

Let this new week be your reminder that every challenge you face is shaping you into something stronger and more valuable. Whether it's a complex denial or a difficult claim, your resilience and attention to detail make all the difference. 

Let’s start fresh, stay focused, and power through this week with purpose and positivity!

Hello Team,

Hope this email finds you well. As discussed in our team meeting held on June 4’ 2025, please find below the Minutes of Meeting (MOM). Kindly review and adhere to the following action items and guidelines:

1.	Follow-Up Task Guidelines:

	If an encounter requires follow-up within 30 days, assign the task to your individual username with the status marked as “In-Progress.”
	For follow-ups beyond 30 days, close the task and ensure timestamping is done correctly.

2.	EOB Request from Zelis:

	EOB requests from the Zelis spreadsheet should be followed up 60 days from the request date.

3.	PI – Denial Code Clarification:

	If a secondary plan denies a claim with PI remark code, it should not be billed to the patient.
	Only claims with PR denial can be billed to the patient.

4.	Do Not Work on COB 2 Balances:

	Avoid working on COB 2-related encounters, even if they have open tasks.
	Focus on COB-1 balances from allocations. If secondary claims are assigned to you, reassign them back to the “Vohra In AR” queue.

5.	Unassigned Encounters and Incentives:

	Unassigned encounters with no resolution will not count toward incentives.
	Encounters reassigned to other teams for resolution are also excluded from incentive calculations.

6.	Case Rate Code Billing Instructions:

	Claims with case rate code 97597 (Billed amount: $800) can be billed only to specific payers like Humana SF and ProCare.
	When correcting COB and billing a different payer, ensure that only one EM code is billed, and the case rate is voided.

7.	Medicaid Pending Protocol

	If both primary and secondary payers have processed and paid, and Medicaid is pending as tertiary, remove Medicaid and bill the patient.

8.	Paid to Patient Workflow

	Do not print the claim status page from Availity for posting.
	If the EOB is not available, create a Manual EOB and send it for posting. Use the “Paid to Pt” status only for the primary payer in such scenarios.

9.	Credentialing Task Assignment

	Assign credentialing tasks to “VIARmgowda, Milan.”
	Before creating the task, check the Collections and Trends Log for existing escalation, review the Modio portal, and make payer calls if required.

10.	Aetna Better Health of CA Address Update

	The new mailing address is:
PO Box 982971, El Paso, TX 79998-2971
(No changes to the Payor ID). Please contact your leads for any clarification or update needs.

Mid-Week Motivation:

"Success doesn’t come from what you do occasionally—it comes from what you do consistently."
Let’s continue to stay focused, accountable, and support one another to achieve our goals.

Greetings Team,
Please find the below points that were discussed in AR Huddle – (06/02/2025)
All State Health Solutions – GCU (Medicare Supplemental Plan):

	For members with ID starting with “GC,” check eligibility and claim status through www.provlookup.com/GCU. 
	Use www.provlookup.com/AllstateHealth for Allstate Health Insurance—both portals function only in AWS with no logins required.

Scott & White Texas – Claim Status & Appeals:

	Access claim and appeal details via the LastPass entry “RightCare path of Scott and White Health Plan.” 
	Always refer to this for Baylor Scott & White related transactions.

QA Error Analysis – Insurance Sequence Accuracy:

	Ensure open balances are placed under the correct insurance sequence. If addressing a primary denial, the COB-1 should reflect the complete balance—not in any other payer line.

Medicaid Eligibility Guidance – Emergency Coverage Caution:

	For Medicaid MN & NY, if eligibility reflects Emergency coverage only, use SLMB/Limited Coverage as the self-pay reason. Avoid submitting to Traditional Medicaid; review denials for 181 errors (inconsistent procedure code and DOS).


 


Coding Review Instructions – CO 50 with N115:

	Claims denied with CO-50 and N115 should not be routed to coding review. Instead, submit an appeal using the provided template. The sample appeal letter has been reattached for your reference.

Medicaid GA Appeals – Follow Proper Protocol:

	Refer to the eLearning Library before submitting Medicaid GA appeals. Appeals need DMA520 Inquiry Form, enabled only 30 days post-denial. If not available, resubmit the claim to activate the option.
 

Medicaid Alabama – Provider Issue Review

	Before routing claims to the credentialing queue, consult the updated spreadsheet: Denial Payer Issues Tracking 2024 & 2025.xlsx. Verify for updates and take action based on findings.

  Denial Payer Issues Tracking 2024 & 2025.xlsx


Please reach out to your respective leads for any clarifications or update corrections.

As we step into a brand-new month, let’s reset our goals and energy. June brings new opportunities, and today is the perfect chance to refocus and reenergize.
“You don't have to be great to start, but you have to start to be great.” — Zig Ziglar

Good morning, Team!!

Eligibility Verification:
	Utilize RDP or Chrome to obtain correct information when checking eligibility for Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) services.

Refunds for Incorrect Payments: 
	If a payment was made in error, even if the TFL (Timely Filing Limit) has been exceeded or no refund letter was received, create a "Request to Initiate Take Back" task to process the refund.

Alignment Payer Information: 
	For Alignment payer eligibility and claim status checks, refer to the official portal: https://avaprovidertools.alignmenthealth.com/.

Handling Coding Denials: 
	For coding denials, contact the payer directly to obtain complete information, then escalate the issue to the coding review team for further action.

which should be submitted to the insurance (along with any other CPTs performed on that 
date). The second line item should reflect the remaining units of CPT 17250, which should not 
be sent to the insurance. Once we receive payment or denial for all other services, an 
adjustment task can then be created.

Good morning, Team!!

Coding Review: 
*	If a corrected claim is denied for the same reason Mandatory payer call with detailed 
information needs to be documented in NG. Need to close the current task and create a new 
CODING REVIEW TASK and assign the task to Vohra in Coding and the subject line needs to be 
updated as ESCALATION and status will be NOT STARTED. 
 

Medicaid SC:
*	Selective Debridement codes (97597 and 97598) are non-payment as per the Medicaid SC 
guidelines. Kindly keep these encounters on Hold and do not adjust the encounters until further 
response from management.

Authorization Denials:
*	When claims are denied due to authorization issues, and we are following up with the payer to 
check if retro authorization is accepted, it is important to validate the correct submission 
method:
1.	Authorization Request Form OR
2.	Clinical Appeal Submission
*	In most cases, payers accept retro authorization when a clinical appeal is submitted. Only when 
the payer representative specifically instructs to submit an authorization request form, we 
should create a  Vohra India Auth Needed  task.
                   If the payer advises to submit an appeal, then proceed by submitting the clinical appeal 
directly.
*	Example Payer: Alignment Health Plan
o	Accepts retro authorization only through clinical appeal.
o	It is mandatory to obtain authorization for all codes for this payer as per the Master 
Auth Library.
*	Ensure proper validation of the retro auth process to avoid delays or misrouted requests.

PDF Merger:  Please reach out to mentors for assistance, Nitro application access is provided.

Appeal Follow up:
*	When following up on an appeal status and if the Appeal is still in process, Kindly Time stamp 
the claim even if its less than 30days. To avoid no response task creation and Multiple touches.
*	Do not create other task, please create Appeal Follow up task, for appeal follow up inventory 
project

TFL appeal:
*	POTF needs to be retrieved from Waystar 
*	Rendering provider signature and the date is Mandatory,
*	Check mark the necessary attachments that is being attached with the appeal documents.

Medica MN appeal update:

proceeding with the next course of action.
>	The Portal will redirect to Availity for all Appeals, Claims and eligibility request.
>	This information is reflecting in Appeals Spread sheet. 

Caresource Dual Plan:
>	Based on the example shared during the call, the encounter was billed with the correct 
Medicaid ID. However, the concern arises when a patient has a dual plan. In such cases, the 
claim should be submitted under the CareSource Medicare Plan ID instead. If we submit the 
claim with a general Medicaid ID, it will be processed as secondary rather than primary, leading 
to a COB denial.

Action Required:
>	Whenever a patient has a dual plan, kindly follow these steps:
>	Verify eligibility in the payer portal.
>	Identify the Medicare policy ID given by the payer and submit the claim under the same ID as 
primary.
>	Once the Medicare portion is paid, the claim should be processed under Medicaid as secondary, 
using the CareSource member ID itself.

Adjustments:
>	Proper analysis and documentation is needed before taking an adjustment. As the adjustment 
accounts are being audited by the Leads and GC s.

starting 02/24/2025 and applies only to Dual Plan cases.

>	When the primary claim is denied, all appeals are exhausted, and the claim is sent to the 
secondary Insurance, if the secondary Insurance denies it, do not use adjustment task 118. 
Instead, create adjustment task as per the New Adjustment Tasks Protocol, and transfer the 
balance back to the primary bucket.

Good Morning Team!!

UHC INDIANA MEDICAID HMO:
>	Do not bill any claims to UHC Indiana Medicaid HMO as there is an issue with the provider s 
address and the taxonomy which gets rejected in Waystar. Reference encounter# 11090610. 

Appeals: 
>	Ensure that the appeal address is validated in Waystar before filing any appeals through mail.
>	Kindly validate the appeal address in Nextgen, and appeal address log with Waystar appeal 
address, If any changes need to be made to the Appeal address in NG or Appeal Addresses Log, 
Kindly send an email to Suresh Reddy-RCM.


Medicare Eligibility:
>	When running eligibility for Medicare, if the eligibility check returns an invalid MBI and other 
DOS have been paid, please verify in Medicare portal to obtain the updated MBI for the member 
and update the MBI in Nextgen and refile the claim to Medicare.

General Points:

>	When cheques are paid to an incorrect address/ past 45 day, need to call payer request for a 
Cheque re-issued to the correct address.
>	No related encounter Task to be worked, only allocated encounter needs to be addressed. For 
rebilling and appeal scenario need to create appropriate task related to the action/denial. 
>	Negative balance encounters are worked by Payment Posting Team. Do not work on encounter 
which are reflecting in negative balance 
>	Do not work on any encounters that have been billed within 21 days of the last billed date.
>	EOB reflecting towards PR- Patient Responsibility, need to bill to secondary payer/Patient. We 
do not bill CO- Contractual Obligation to secondary/Patient.
>	The balance will automatically move to payer bucket if Medicaid Fin class payers reflected in 
Insurance sequence Tab when billing the balance to Patient. Need to remove Medicaid from 
sequence while billing Patient.  
>	If you find out the correct payer for the claim and its past TFL do not create Initiate to Refund 
Task for the incorrect payer, were we received the payment initially. Initiate to Refund Task 
should only be created if we are within the TFL for the correct payer. 
>	If we file a claim to the correct payer which we have past the TFL, we will not have any proof 
from the initial payer to support the TFL appeal. We need a correspondence/remittance from 
the initial payer to support the TFL denial.
>	No one should be creating Related Encounter, Vohra tasks when we run out of space in one 
note.  Create the same type of task you are working on.
>	If any changes are made to a task, such has updating who it was assigned to, or changing a 
subject, you still need to post notes even if you posted notes in other tasks worked the same 
day or it will be marked as critical.

Denials with Code  PR :

If a claim is denied with a PR code (e.g., PR197 or PR96), and filing an appeal is not possible due to the 
claim being past the appeal filing limit with no active secondary payer, bill the claim to the patient 
(applicable only for commercial payers). Do not adjust the claim as past the appeal filing limit.

Commercial Payers:

If a claim is denied due to the provider not being credentialed but the patient has out-of-network (OON) 
benefits, do not create a credentialing task or move the claim to the credentialing team. Instead, contact 
the payer and request the representative to process the claim as out-of-network. 

NPI Issues:

If the NPI is not enrolled with Facility. this needs to be escalated to the Credentialing Department. The 
designated users there will contact the facility directly to verify whether they are enrolled in Medicare 
or Medicaid.. 

Baylor Scott & White:

If a claim is partially paid and any CPT is denied as inclusive, check the portal for the exact denial 
description for denied CPT, as the EOB may not provide complete information.

Provider Rejection:

>	if the claim is rejected due to missing facility information in box #32, do not work on it. Instead, 
find the facility name in the Medical Records and escalate the issue to the leads.
                

Patient enrolled in Hospice:

>	If the patient is enrolled in hospice, submit the claim to Medicare for Humana SF, regardless of 
the VBID module.  
>	If the claim is billed with case rate codes, it cannot be submitted to Medicare with a GW 
modifier. Instead, document the details clearly in the notes and close the task and create 
 Review CPT/HCPCS  and assign the task to the Vohra In Billing team.
>	Example: For Enc#10914398, the claim was billed to Humana SF with CPT 97597 for a billed 
amount of $800 and was denied due to the patient being enrolled in hospice. In such cases, the 
task should be assigned to the Billing team to modify the charges and bill the correct CPT codes 
to Medicare.
>	Ensure that you address all other dates of service (DOS) that fall within the hospice episode 
dates.
Request to Initiate Take back Task:

>	When a Payer initiated a refund and the refund process is complete, review the transaction to 
verify whether the Payer offset request was posted. If the Payer offset request was posted, do 
not create Request to initiate take back task.

DDP Documents:

>	To submitting an appeal for DDP codes, if there are no documents found in Medline and 
McKesson(Invoice & Tracking), update the information in the   DDP request-Quest.xlsx and 
assign the task under your name. Once the DDP documents received through email from Suresh 
Reddy-RCM, ensure the appeals are submitted as a priority, as we might past the Appeal filling 
limit.

Deceased Patient:

>	If the insurance denies a claim due to the patient being deceased, and the date was either 
incorrectly updated in eligibility or unavailable, please create a "Deceased Patient" task and 
assign it to the RI Team.

General Updates:

>	If the adjustment was made for the balance billed to the patient, do not reverse it to bill the 
patient. If the date of service (DOS) is after the patient's date of death, create a "Deceased 
Patient Task" and assign it to RI.
>	When sending any escalation emails to leads, kindly CC QA 
Leadership(QALeadership@vohraphysicians.com) on the email.
>	Do not close any Auth Task in NG, even if the task created due to a timestamp or resubmission 
outside of NG.
>	If a Coding Review task is created for a coding denial received from Traditional Medicare, do not 
close the coding task. Ensure the balance remains in the MCR financial class, create an MCARE 
Denial Review task, and assign it to the Super User.
>	If the appeal address in NG differs from the correct appeal address listed in the Appeal 
Addresses Log, please send an email to Suresh Reddy   RCM, requesting the correct address to 
be updated in NG.
New Codes(T-Codes):
>	If T-Codes (0640T or 0859T) along with a WC code are denied, and the denial-related task has 
been created and assigned to Vohra in AR Team (1/2/3/4/5), kindly follow up with the payer to 
document the denial reason for the wound care code. Then, assign the task to Naybel D Vega 
with the task status set to "In-Progress". For example, if 0640T and 11042 are denied on the 
claim, follow up with the payer for 11042, document the necessary action for 11042, and assign 
the task to Naybel.
>	If T-codes alone denied, document and assign the task to Naybel with the task status set to "In-
Progress".
Medicaid KY:
>	If we received denial from MCD KY, Kindly correct the payer to ensure the claim is billed with the 
correct configuration. This applies ONLY for Hazelwood.
>	Follow below steps for resubmission:
1.	Go to the encounter
2.	Delete Medicaid KY from the profile
3.	Add insurance   APRN Medicaid KY as the insurance
4.	Resubmit the claim
              
Billing Process:
>	If the primary payer denied the claim with Contractual Obligation(CO) and appeal has been sent 
to payer and Appeal upheld, do not bill the claim to secondary instead adjust the claim with 101 
adjustment task.
>	If the primary payer denied the claim as Past Timely filing and no POTF found to appeal on the 
claim, do not bill the claim to secondary, Instead adjust the claim with 105 adjustment task.
>	If the primary payer processes and denies a claim with PR, do not adjust the claim. 
1.	If there is an active secondary payer, bill the claim to the secondary 
payer.
2.	If no secondary payer is available, submit one level of appeal. If the 
appeal is upheld, bill the balance to the patient. 
3.	If the primary payer is MCR MCO and Appeal submitted with WOL, 
do not bill the claim to Patient, Instead adjust the claim.
Refunds:

>	If the two-payer paid in error as primary and the Payer offset was posted for the payment 
received from incorrect payer and the outstanding balance is reflecting in Negative, do not 
create review and correct posting task. Instead document the same and close the open task 
stating once the recouped EOB received and posted, balance will be zeroed.

new services being trialed with two of our physicians. Kindly refer to Naybel's email shared to 
Quest Collections for further details.
>	These codes should only be worked when submitting a fresh claim to the payer. For example, if 
a claim was rejected for eligibility and the correct payer is identified, it should be billed 
accordingly. 

Review and Correct Posting task:

>	If a payment has been posted to a CPT code and there is a contractual adjustment along with a 
patient responsibility in open balance, please create a 'Review and Correct Posting' task. Ensure 
to document clearly in the notes the contractual adjustment amount and the patient 
responsibility.

ALJ Letters:

>	For any encounter related to an ALJ, the MCR team will not work on it. 
>	If a second-level appeal is upheld and the claim requires ALJ, please assign to Liliam Posada s 
queue and update the status as InProgress, add subject as ALJ DUE MM/DD/YYY in the same 
task, No follow-up date is required. ALJ will be handled by ALJ Team.
>	If the MIST code is listed on the claim that requires ALJ, kindly close the task and create a 
'Review ALJ' task and make sure assigned to is  Liliam Posada . Since the script will reassign the 
task back to the MIST team if there is an open MIST balance.

General Updates:

>	Please ensure not to override previous notes or coding notes when adding notes to a specific 
task.
>	If the Script or BOT adjusts the entire balance without creating a task for any denial due to 
backend script, please escalate the issue to the leads.
>	If the denial codes listed on the EOB are not posted for the CPT denied in NG, a denial task will 
not be created. When working on a denied claim with multiple CPTs, kindly check in Transaction 
details, if a denial code is not posted for a specific CPT under line-item reasons, please escalate 
the issue to the leads.

Payer sequence:

>	If the payment or denial is in posting for the primary payer and we are working on the 
secondary and sequence need to be corrected on the encounter, do not state that the payment 
is posting and close the task. Instead, update the sequence as follows.
>	Go to Encounter insurance tab and right click and select  New". Then you can add or change the 
secondary payer.
 
 
>	For example, in encounter 10782349, where the primary BCBS has paid and payment is in-
progress for primary payer, but Medicare needs to be added in sequence: go to "New," add 
Medicare as the secondary payer, and set Medicaid as tertiary. Once the payment is posted, the 
claim will be billed to the secondary payer by BOT.

Adding referring provider:

>	The Referring physician is missing on the encounter: 
a.	Review insurance eligibility for the patient s PCP name to be added as the referring 
physician. 
(this does not apply to Medicare and Medicaid traditional, only HMOs and some PPOs).
b.	If NG eligibility does not have a PCP use the referring physician as per the medical 
records.
 
 

>	Check whether the referring provider is added in NG for the patient. If the referring provider is 
added, If the claim is rejected in waystar, archive the rejected claim and rebill the claim through 
NG with referring provider. If the claim denied from payer, kindly resubmit the corrected claim 
through NG.
              
>	If the referring provider is not added in NG: Navigate to the General tab and open Encounter 
Information as shown in the image below. Then, click on the torch symbol, search for the 
provider using their first and last name. If the provider is listed, add them and proceed with the 
necessary action. 
 
 

>	If the referring provider is not listed in NG and claim need to be billed with referring provider, 
Kindly follow the Add Referring provider protocol.

POS Denials:

>	If the E&M codes are denied for POS, review the medical record and refer to the Telemed and 
Telehome Billing Department Protocol available in eLearning to identify and apply the correct 
codes and submit the corrected claim.
>	For instance, after reviewing the protocol, if it is determined that as per the medical record, the 
POS is correct, but the billed CPT is incorrect, update clearly in documentation and assign the 
task to Coding(For primary commercial payers).
 
Reworks:

>	QA reworks must be completed by every Monday EOD, and consolidated rebuttals should be 
shared to Leads.
>	The errors marked by the QA team should be reworked to prevent additional errors for the 
same encounter. If the Associate was on leave, the task should be allocated to 
Mentors/SMEs to complete the rework.

denied as CO4 (the procedure code is inconsistent with the modifier used or a required modifier 
is missing), please proceed with the Bundled Appeal package
>	Going forward, when BOT submits an appeal, it will no longer add a timestamp to the claim in 
NG. Instead, BOT will update the "last bill date" in NG to trigger a "no response" task if no 
response is received from the payer within the expected timeframe.
Provider related Issues(NPI or Taxonomy):

>	When there is a denial or rejection related to the NPI for facility, please validate the NPI in both 
the NPPES and EMR portals before escalating. If everything appears correct in both systems,

name, ensure file name is documented in the notes to avoid QA errors.

Review and Correct Posting:

>	When the payment posting team posted payment or correspondence in NextGen, verify that

Beneficiary), it indicates that the member is active on the date of service (DOS). Do not bill the 
balance to the patient if SLMB with Title 19 is returned; instead, bill the claim to Medicaid.

General Updates:

>	It's acceptable to create adjustment tasks while a batch is still in Pencil Posting.
>	Before adding a claim to the escalation log, ensure you have reviewed the escalation log 
provided by Lilliana to avoid duplication.
>	Verify that the issue hasn't already been escalated and that all necessary information is included 
in the log before moving it forward for further review.

Ins, do not bill the claim to secondary payer. Instead bill the balance to Patient and update the 
self-pay reason in Encounter specifics tab as  Paid to Patient .
>	If there is no PTR from Primary Ins, And if we have Medicaid as secondary Ins, Then remove 
Medicaid from sequence and bill the balance to Patient. Update the self-pay reason in 
Encounter specifics tab as  Paid to Patient .
>	Then check in Accounts, If we are within 15 days from the statement print date, need to close 
the task. If we passed 15 days from statement print date, Print Paid to patient letter from NG

Back" task for Medicare (e.g., Enc#9685144).
>	If the claim includes the original billed amount and Medicare eligibility verification indicates that 
the patient has ProCare Advantage as their Medicare MCO, please keep the claim set to bill to

Process Updates:

?	Appeal Guidelines:

>	Effective from 10/23/2024 when submitting the Appeal, do not enter the date in the 'Appeal 
Date' field under the General tab. Instead, update the 'Appeal Date' only in the Encounter-
Specific tab according to the level of Appeal 
submission.                   
  
 

>	If the Appeal date has already been updated in the General tab, kindly remove it to prevent an 
external QA critical error.

?	Review and Correct Posting Task:

>	A Review and Correct Posting task should be created if the secondary payment is incorrectly 
posted under the Primary Insurance. For example, in Enc#10560769, the primary MCR paid with 
PTR, and the secondary was removed from the sequence, but we received a payment from the 
secondary payer, which was incorrectly posted under the primary payer. In such scenarios, 
please create a Review and Correct Posting task.
>	When creating a Review and Correct Posting task, ensure to clearly document what needs to be 
corrected in the posted payment.

General Updates:

>	Score Card: Effective from September, the scorecard will be updated as follows Production 
over 100% will receive a rating of 5, and Production between 90% and 99.99% will receive a 
rating of 4. Please refer to the attached screenshot for reference:
                
>	Work from home policy: If the Quality and Production scores were red for the previous week, 
Work from Home will not be approved. Please do not submit a request if the criteria are not 
met.

on the denials, as these are new services being trialed with two of our physicians. Kindly refer 
to Naybel's email shared to Quest Collections for further details.

Balance Control:

>	If a claim has been processed and partially paid for one or more CPTs but others were denied 
and we have an active secondary, while working on the denied CPT for the primary, ensure the 
paid CPTs patient's responsibility remains under the primary insurance.

Duplicate Denial:

*	For encounters denied as duplicates or B13-Payment for this claim/service may have been 
provided in a previous payment, validate the paid EOB or Correspondence received and confirm 
if the payment received was posted in NG under a different account for the same patient. If the 
payment was posted under a different account for the same patient, escalate the issue to your 
leads to prevent future discrepancies in payment posting or to avoid Duplicate billing for same 
patient.

Good Morning Team!!

Hope this Email finds you well..

SNF Scenario:

>	If the patient was receiving SNF benefits for the DOS, do not adjust the claim as previously 
instructed in MOM 08052024. Instead, change the POS to 31 and submit the corrected claim for 
commercial payers. If the patient was not in SNF, continue submitting the appeal with eligibility 
proof from the CGS DME portal. Exception: If only selective debridement, Mist or Pico codes are 
billed without any other WC CPT codes on the claim, they can be adjusted.
>	For commercial Payer with any SNF-related denials, do not work on them. Instead, document 
the issue and assign the claim to Vohra in AR Team 6.
>	For Medicare we submit the reopening by changing POS.

Refund Request:

>	When the payment posting team has posted the Payer offset requested letter (Refund request 
letter) and closed the Request to initiate Take back task stating Payer offset amount has taken, 
and if the payment still appears under the Insurance tab in payments, do not create a Review 
and Correct Posting task. Instead, document it as  initiated Refund request to payer, once the 
recoupment EOB is received, Offset EOB will be posted, and the balance will be zero from the 
payer payments  and close the task. Example encounter   9752367. 
 
   
  
 

>	If there is an open balance with no patient responsibilities, the balance should be adjusted 
under the 109 Adjustment Task. If there are patient responsibilities, the patient needs to be 
billed.

Appeals Packages:

>	Appeal packages that submitted through Fax, Package should be placed in the designated path 
on same day, confirmation page can be placed within 24Hrs.
>	Portal submitted packages should be placed with the proof on the designated path on same day 
the action is taken in Nextgen.
>	Appeal submitted via mail packages should be placed on the designated path on same day the 
action is taken in Nextgen.

Hi, Good Morning Team!!

Hope this Email finds you well  As per Discussion in the Team meeting.

General Points:

>	Whenever we create a task, we must ensure that the appropriate task type is selected and 
assigned to the correct individual or team.
>	If the balance is Medicare responsible, Need to create MCARE Denial review package and assign 
to Super User.
>	If the balance is Commercial payer responsible, Need to create COMM Denial review package 
and assign to Vohra in AR.
>	If the balance is Medicaid payer responsible, Need to create MCAID Denial review package and 
assign to Vohra in AR.
>	Need to Make sure that the protocols and the MOM are being followed and if there is any 
discrepancy, Kindly inform Leads and GC to have it updated.

Hospice:

>	If Medicare is the secondary payer and BCBS TX is the primary, and the patient is enrolled in 
Hospice, the GW modifier needs to be added, and the claim should be billed to BCBS.
>	If the patient is enrolled in Hospice, the claim should be billed to United Mine Workers with the 
GW modifier, regardless of the VBID model. Example ENC#9833650.
>	If the patient is enrolled in Hospice, If a claim was processed and paid by Medicare Traditional as 
primary, and we also receive payments from United Healthcare Medicare plan, we should not 
refund payment to UHC. Instead, we need to check the EOB to determine whether UHC 
processed the plan as primary or secondary. If UHC processed as secondary, appropriate actions 
should be taken, Since UHC will act as a supplement plan in this scenario.

should keep in In-Progress, and assign the task to Vohra in AR Team 3.

payments have been made to different encounter numbers and this information can be 
retrieved from the portal and payer call.
>	WellCare has two levels of appeals; for the second level, do not attach the Dispute form.

Hi, Good Morning Team!!

Hope this Email finds you well  As per Discussion in the Team meeting.

General Updates:

>	If multiple tasks are opened for the same encounter and are assigned to Vohra in AR or any 
Vohra in AR Team (1/2/3/4/5), please close the duplicate tasks accordingly.
>	If there is an option to submit the appeal through the portal, please prioritize using the portal to 
file the appeal.
>	Wellsense appeal filing time is 150 days from the date of denial, and it should not exceed 300 
days from the date of service (DOS).


Review and correct Posting Task:

>	Before creating a Review and correct posting task, mention the exact reason for the correction 
in the payment posted. For example, if CPT 99309 got paid $100.00 but the payment was posted 
for CPT 11043, specify this discrepancy in the documentation.

SNF Scenario:

>	If the patient was not receiving SNF benefits for the DOS and submitted an appeal that was 
upheld, do not file the claim to the secondary payer, Instead adjust the wound

General Updates:

>	If multiple CPTs are denied in a claim and an appeal results in partial payment with one CPT still 
denied for the same reason, do not proceed with another level of appeal. Instead, adjust the 
claim or submit it to the secondary payer if there is an active secondary payer.
>	Appeal packages should be placed on the same day the encounter was originally worked, even if 
the encounter was reworked on a different date; the appeal package should be kept with the 
initial worked date.
>	When placing manual consolidation in Path, it is necessary to mention the exact dates in the 
completion date collum.
>	Do not mention "secondary payer" or "tertiary payer" in documentation. Instead, specify the 
Payer name. For example, if working on secondary claims for Medicaid OH, document as 
follows: "DOS 07/29/2024, Medicaid OH, CPT Codes .

Kaiser Permanente of Mid Atlantic:

>	For Authorization denial need to use the below verbiage in Authorization denial letter:

                                DOS:
                                Denial Reason: Denial for no Authorization
                                Denied CPT: (Only procedures)
                                Please review the enclosed medical documentation. The procedure was performed 
per the facility request to our physician due to patient medical condition. The services were provided 
prior to obtaining authorization, to avoid delay in care which could result in  
                                wound complications including deterioration, amputation, infection, hospitalization, 
and death.  Emergency wound care was provided in the absence of another contracted / available 
wound care physician. Medical documentation supporting need for services  
                                attached.  Please review and reimburse accordingly.

Hi Team, 
 
Please see the updated pointer for 
 
Medicare eligibility determination protocol:

In scenarios where MCARE eligibility returns MA Bill Option Code-1.Need to check from the list if 
the payer is part of Health Care Provider Plans (HCPP) employee/union sponsored managed care plan or 
a cost plan (where a Cost Contract offers the full Medicare benefit package). If it is, then claim needs to 
be billed to that HCPP/Cost Plan instead of Medicare. 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Thank you.

Hope this Email finds you well  As per Discussion in the Team meeting.

General updates:

>	If both Medicare and Medicaid return same Payer as MCO, add only Particular payer dual plan in 
Insurance Tab. Only if Patient is enrolled in hospice, kindly keep Medicare as the primary and 
add Medicaid MCO as secondary with the Medicaid ID#(Refer MOM 07172024).
>	If the secondary payer denied the claim and the claim needs to be adjusted, but the EOB/ERA is 
not posted in NG, but available in Waystar, place the EOB/ERA in the designated path, create a 
Paid Pending Processing task, and assign the task to Omega Posting. Note: Do not create 
adjustment task until EOB is posted.
>	Before creating Facility call required task, Review all the related transaction notes on the DOS 
for appropriate action.
Reworks:

>	QA reworks must be completed, and consolidated rebuttals should be shared by 07/23/2024 
at 11:00 PM IST.
>	The errors marked by the QA team should be reworked to prevent additional errors for the 
same encounter. If the Associate was on leave, the task should be allocated to 
Mentors/SMEs to complete the rework.

Medicare eligibility determination protocol:

>	If Medicare eligibility returns the message "MA BILL OPTION Code-1," even if Medicare has 
an MCO plan, add Medicare as primary in sequence and bill the claim to Medicare.

New Task Creation:

>	New Task will be created by Associates only in two scenarios:
1.	If the task status was marked as 'Completed' in error, do not reopen the completed task 
to change the status to In-Progress or Not Started. Instead, create a new same task with 
a short note stating,  Reopening task due to task closed incorrectly .
2.	Before posting notes, Task has been closed due to a timestamp/resubmitting the claim 
in NG, kindly create a same new task with short note in the new task as  Task closed 
due to Timestamp/resubmitted . For Medicare appeals submitted for Wound Care 
codes with a timestamp on the claim, if the open task is needed because the A codes are 
sent for review to appeal but the task has been closed due to a timestamp, kindly create 
a new task with a short note stating  Task closed due to Timestamp .

Medi-Cal:

>	Wound debridement CPT codes 11043, 11044, 11046, and 11047 are reimbursable in all places

Hi, Good Morning Team!!

Hope this Email finds you well  As per Discussion in the Team meeting.

Protocols:

>	Any new protocol must be approved by either Doyle or Noelle. If the protocol is not approved 
and the task is executed based on the new protocol, it will be considered an error.

Assigning Task:

>	If claims are assigned to a Super User for further clarification or analysis, please update the 
subject as 'Escalated' to ensure the task is reassigned to Mentors, SMEs, or Group Coordinators 
for review. This is applicable only for commercial or Medicaid claims.
>	For Medicare denials, continue to close the task and create a 'MCARE Denial Review Package' 
task without mentioning any subject.

Self-Pay Reasons:

>	Self-pay reasons will be updated and shared with the team. If the exact self-pay reason is not 
available, update it with the closest matching reason and do not leave it blank. Escalate it to the 
leads to add it to the protocol.

Medicaid TX secondary claims:

>	If the primary commercial payer processed and paid the claim with Patient Responsibility as 
Copay, do not bill the claim to secondary Medicaid TX with a crossover form. Instead, adjust the 
balance using the 118-adjustment code.

Hi, Good Morning Team!!

Hope this Email finds you well  As per Discussion in the Team meeting.

Medicare Claims:

>	If a Medicare claim is denied due to a missing or invalid patient identifier, check eligibility to see 
if the effective date of change has been updated. If it has, call BCDR and provide the SSN or 
previous Medicare ID, along with the patient s name and date of birth, to obtain the updated ID. 
>	If you are unable to retrieve the Medicare ID, check the EMR for the Medicaid ID and verify 
eligibility to find the new Medicare ID. If you still cannot find the Medicare ID with the 
information listed, create a Facility Call Required task.

Secondary claim submission:

>	If claims are rejected in NG due to any CCI/Mod edits, do not submit the dirty claims through 
NG. Per the new instructions, keep the claim set to rebill for secondary as well.

Medicaid FL:

>	If a claim is denied with code 0721 stating "Recipient is ineligible for DOS, denied after being 
pended for 14 days. Contact DCF district office." kindly keep the task in progress for 14 days with 
proper documentation.

Please find the updated information for Revocation Code 1 as highlighted in yellow:

-	Revocation Code 1:  (when patient is enrolled in hospice and rev code is 1 in the middle of the 
month)
               DOS after the hospice period ended ,with rev code 1 only for states(as mentioned below) , 
hospice period is month to month. Meaning, even if dos is after the hospice period end date still claim 
needs to be billed to MCARE with GW modifier.

As per the updated Protocol for Denial Patient Enrolled In Hospice: Atta
It is important to note: When someone decides to stop receiving Medicare coverage for hospice 
care during a specific period, they will start receiving their regular Medicare benefits again. If the 
person was enrolled in a Medicare Advantage (MA) Plan that does not participate in the VBID 
program when they chose hospice care, all Medicare claims will be paid by the fee-for-service 
contractor (A/B MAC) until the first day of the month after they stop hospice care.

>	If the ERA in NG has posted incompletely, please cross-reference with the EOB on Waystar for 
clarification.
>	Please submit the corrected claim with all CPT codes and include the original claim number, as 
the initial claim was submitted incorrectly by the BOT with a single line after down code, 
resulting in a denial "Inclusive." Please do not proceed with an appeal for this claim.
>	For Referring Provider denials, please verify Medicaid eligibility or medical records for Referring 
Provider details. Once the referring provider is found, add in NG and resubmit the claim to the

as of MOM 01-31-2024.

MOM 03182024

Hi team,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to correct an error in our previous MOM 03182024 
regarding the Authorization of Representative (AOR). Upon review found that "Assignment of Benefits" 
was incorrectly mentioned instead of "Authorization of Representative(AOR)."

>	After reviewing the claim, it has been determined that the claim was denied due to non-covered 
charges as per the patient's plan. Upon further investigation, it was found that the patient does 
not have out-of-network benefits, and the provider is considered out-of-network. If the 
representative is requesting to add an Assignment of Benefits (AOR) or Consent form from the 
patient in the appeal package, and no active secondary payer was found, please bill the claim to 
the patient.

Kindly feel free to reach out if you have any questions or require further clarification on this.

to verify whether the same CPT code was billed in the same month. For example, if CPT 99309 
was paid and 99308 was denied for this reason, it is necessary to call and request a reprocess. If 
the representative mentions that it was paid for a different provider, gather the information and 
proceed with appealing the claim.
>	For Humana Medicare replacement HMO plan, E&M for Telemed will only be paid twice in 14 
days. If an E&M was previously billed without Mod 95 and received payment, then we can 
append Modifier 95 for the second time within 14 days. If we received payment twice with and 
without modifier 95 then other E/m codes during this period (14 days) can be adjusted.
>	When submitting the corrected claim, kindly make sure to use original claim number. 
>	When creating an Appeal Needed task, it is essential to document the required information 
according to the Appeals Documentation Protocol.
>	Before creating an appeal needed task for any denial, Need to verify the medical records to 
determine if wound sites are resolved. If the wound sites are resolved, then create Adjustment 
task and complete the claim. However, if the wound sites are not resolved, an appeal for the 
claim should be initiated.
>	For Medicare MCOs, when a coder makes changes on a claim and indicates "Billing on Hold" or 
"Hold to Bill" in the subject, kindly have those claims submitted to the payer as there is no hold 
for MCO s.

>	If Medicare MCO denied claim as Patient enrolled in Hospice. After confirming the Medicare 
eligibility and discovering that the patient's enrolment in hospice ended with Revocation code-1 
(date of service is not within the same month), it is necessary to contact the payer and request a 
reprocessing of the denied claim. If the representative is unwilling to proceed with reprocessing 
and advises appealing the decision, the next step is to submit an appeal citing Medicare benefits 
determination using the Invalid Hospice Denial Form.
>	Create a Payer Review Task to request the creation of a new payer or updates to an existing 
payer's ID or mailing address in Nextgen.
>	If the claim was processed and applied towards patient responsibility such as deductible and if 
we cannot retrieve EOB from Instamed, need to create dummy EOB for patient responsibility 
and place the EOB for posting in S-drive.
>	If the email sent seeking clarification on Taxonomy, NPI issues or Credentialing matters, it is 
essential to follow up with the previous email, if no response is received and after subsequent 
review found that a claim requires clarification, please document notes accordingly and assign

as the email has been sent and time needs to be allowed for a response.
>	After creating the task, please ensure that the "Assigned To" field is updated correctly.

Adding MOM 02-12-2024 to keep in loop:

>	The task must be closed with documentation prior to filing a claim to the payer or Timestamping 
the claim.
>	Non covered charges:
1.	If claim denied as Non covered charges as per Patient policy, First level Appeal need to 
send if no active secondary payer listed and after Appeal upheld need to bill Patient.
2.	If you have active secondary payer in sequence, do not send Appeal to primary. Bill the 
claim to secondary.
>	A task for initiating an appeal(Appeal Needed task) can be created based on the encounter 
where the claims for different dates of service (DOS) for the same patient were denied with the

Hi, Very Good Morning Team!!

Hope this Email finds you well  As per Discussion in the Team meeting.

*	Paid to Patient:
-	When ever we have Paid to Patient task, we need to follow the protocol in the eLearning.
-	Once the Dummy EOB/EOB/correspondence posted in NG, we need to check weather we 
any patient responsibilities from the primary Insurance. If we have PTR from primary Ins, 
need to bill the claim to secondary Insurance. 
-	If there is no PTR from Primary Ins, And if we have Medicaid as secondary Ins, Then remove 
Medicaid from sequence and bill the balance to Patient. Update the self-pay reason in 
Encounter specifics tab as  Paid to Patient .
-	Then check in Accounts, If we are within 15 days from the statement print date, need to 
close the task. If we passed 15 days from statement print date, Print Paid to patient letter 
from NG along with Paid to Patient EOB and place in Sdrive(S:\Vohra to print from 
Omega\Appeals to print\Pay to Patient letters).

          
 

*	Primary payer denied for OON Benefits:  
-	When we receive denial from primary payer as claim denied for Out of Network benefits, 
Need to call the Payer and must find weather claim denied based on Patient policy or 
Provider Contract.
-	If the claim denied for OON Benefits and rep stated Provider is OON, we need to submit 
Non-Par Provider Appeal. 
-	If the claim denied for Patient Plan, we need to submit the first level Appeal and If the 
Appeal upheld, if there is secondary Ins listed, need to file the claim to secondary Ins. If 
there is no secondary payer move the balance to self-pay. Update the self-pay reason in 
Encounter specifics tab as  Non covered charges .
-	If the claim denied for OON Benefits, After calling to payer if we find claim denied as 
Provider is OON and need to Auth# to process the claim, Then we must follow Authorization 
Protocol.

*	COB Pending:
-	After checking Medicare eligibility, if we find Commercial plan listed as Medicare MCO, 
Need to Verify eligibility for Medicare MCO and if we find Medicare MCO is inactive for DOS, 
Then we have to move the claim for COB pending. 
-	If any commercial returning as Dula plan in Portal, But after verifying Medicare eligibility in 
NG found as Medicare is primary and no MCO listed in eligibility, Then bill the claim to 
Medicare as primary.
-	If both Medicare and Medicaid eligibility returns same commercial as MCO, need to add 
Dual plan in Insurance tab and remove both Medicare and Medicaid.

*	Secondary claim submission:
-	When submitting the claim to secondary after receiving payment from primary Ins, if the 
claim rejected for Modifier or coding issue, need to push the claim as dirty. Do not keep 
secondary claim as Set to rebill. 
-	Apart from Provider hold, all other rejected claims can be bill as Dirty for secondary 
submission. 
-	If any task created after pushing the claim as dirty, if we find any task created based on 
rejection then need to post notes and close the task(Ex: CCI Edits task) 
       
*	Before creating Appeal needed task for any denial if we find any claim received payment in 
previous DOS from Ins from initial electronic submission, we need to call and ask for reprocess. 
If Rep not accepting for reprocess and suggested to Appeal, collect required info as per Appeal 
needed protocol and create the task.
*	Sunshine Health plan denies the E&M codes as Max Benefits existed stating only 1 E&M will be 
covered as per Payer guidelines, In this scenario we need to call payer and get the previous E&M 
code paid details and if we come to know as true denial then we could submit to secondary if it 
listed or create the adjustment task.
*	After receiving denial for corrected claim denial with new ICN# and if we are submitting the 
Appeal to Ins we have to use corrected claim number, Instead Original claim number. And we 
must document in Documentation when we are moving claim for Appeal needed task. 

Adding MOM of 01-15-2024 to keep in loop.

*	Do not Bill the claims for 2024, Anything prior to 2024 need to bill the claims. Medicare SC and 
Medicare TX need to keep the claims set to rebill.
*	Whenever billing the claim to Medicare or Medicaid MCO, We need to remove the Traditional 
Medicare/Medicaid from the sequence.
*	Need to find the Correct Medicaid MCO for the particular Month and has to add the Payer in 
sequence and need to bill the claim.
*	When we are billing the claim to Insurance, need to keep the Balance under same Insurance and 
must bill the claim.
*	Don t keep the Inactive Ins both in payer sequence in Insurance Tab and in Patient Information.
*	When we are working on 2 or more CPT s, If the Primary Insurance paid one CPT and other CPT s 
denied and submitting the corrected claim or resubmitting claim to primary Ins, we have to keep 
the paid CPT left out balance in Primary Ins and submit the entire claim.
*	Whenever submitting the corrected claim to Medicare MCO s, commercials, Medicaid and 
Medicaid MCO s need to bill the entire claim to particular Ins. Only for Traditional Medicare 
need to bill the claim with denied CPT.
*	When the claims moving for Coding review, We must add the Appeal details(Portal/fax#/Appeal 
address) and Appeal Timely filling limit and Correct claim mailing address with corrected claim 
TFL.
*	If the Appeal TFL is getting over within 2 to 15 days, need to Mention as Priority as High in 
Appeal Needed Task.

 

Adding MOM of 01-02-2024 to keep in loop.

Traditional MCR claim Deductible Hold:

*	After verifying MCR eligibility if you find MCR Part B with any Deductible will have a 60 Day hold 
from date of service.
*	If MCR that returns QMB will have a hold date of March 15, 2024. This is due to the Eligibility 
tool does not return a deductible amount when it returns QMB.
*	No One is to push any 2024 claims out. 
*	Any other insurance that is not straight MCR for 2024 is not going to be billed until we turn the 
BBP billing jobs on. But they will not have a hold dates.
*	Any DOS prior to 01/01/2024; will still be worked as usual. 

Hold date can be seen after keeping claim set to rebill. Hold date will be in Encounter Maintenance Tab 
  Billing & Collections.

 



AR Appeals: 

Any claim required to Appeal need to post the Documentation and close the Denial task and created 
Appeal Needed task. In Appeal needed task post the comments and keep the task in Not started.

next step (if we are in time frame to submit 2nd level they will create the   Appeal 
Required  task, if the time frame lapsed they can go ahead and create adjustment task ) 
and place the letter just to get it posted, with encounter number and a Suffix as    NT  
in below path.
 

*	If any claim past Time frame of Appeal(1st level/2nd level) do not move the claim to Appeals team 
to adjust the claim, Post the documentation and create Adjustment task.

-	Medicare partial denied claims, only the denied CPT should be submitted as a Corrected claim to 
Medicare payer.
-	Do not submit the corrected claim with the paid CPT/whole claim to Medicare 


>	Paid to Patient Task:
-	While working on Paid to Patient Task, check the Print Statement date, if the date is under

Hi Team,

As per Discussion:

>	AR Tasks not assigned correctly:
Any change of task type need to assign to correct Assigned To. Do not leave the Assign To tab 
blank or move it incorrectly.

>	Medicaid TX secondary payer eligibility:
Medicaid TX secondary payer claim eligibility should be check in Waystar portal to determine 
the Medicaid MCO plan is an LTC plan or not.
               For other insurance need to check eligibility in NG, specific payer portal and NG for eligibility.

>	Untick inactive payer in Nextgen:
Inactive payer, LTC plan for Medicaid HMO secondary payer and no medical coverage plan by 
the payer, need to untick the Green active tick from the payer sequence and Available Insurance 
Tab.
Do not untick the appropriate active payer from sequence, expect the above scenario.

specific letters mentioned in Medical Necessity portal.

>	PPHP MD and Humana SF update.
              If the patient insurance is listed as Humana SF or PPHP MD under the payer insurance tab in the 
NextGen and it was verified that the payer is incorrect a coding task will need to be created for 
coding                          to validate that the encounter gets billed with the correct charge amount. 

1.	Make sure you update the encounter to reflect the correct insurance.
2.	Be clear and specific with your notes.
3.	Do not bill the claim.
4.	Create a coding task.
5.	This applies only for the case rate code (97597).
